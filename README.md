# Cerebro-Gradient_AI_Hackathon

## Problem Statement : 
Despite access to historical trading charts, traders lack an efficient tool to analyze and accurately predict future trends, leading to suboptimal decision-making. Furthermore, the absence of transparent systems reduces trust in trading predictions. Our solution leverages AI to provide reliable trend forecasts while integrating blockchain technology to ensure transparency and accountability in the prediction process

## Results:
We ran the tests overnight for ETHUSDT and BTCUSDT and we got the following results:For ETH:
It had a total of 20 buy orders and a total of 68 sell orders.
The average buy price for the orders came out to be $3644.52 and the average sell price came out to be $3653.61.

For BTC:
-It had a total of  buy orders and a total of 2 sell orders.
-The average buy price for the orders came out to be $96283.53 and the average sell price came out to be $96374.71.

Hence we can observe that, at an average we have bought the coin at a lower price and sold it at a higher price, usually for Futures trades we use a leverage, so at a high leverage of 25-30x , we will end up making a good profit on our trades.
